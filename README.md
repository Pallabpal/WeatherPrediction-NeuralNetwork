# Weather Forecasting of Kharagpur

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting future weather temperatures and classifying weather conditions for upcoming days using advanced neural networks. We have employed several models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), XGBoost, and ARIMA, to forecast weather temperature. After comparing their performance, we found that the RNN model provides the most accurate predictions.
## Models
1. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
   
The RNN model was found to be the most effective for predicting future weather temperatures. We trained the RNN model on historical weather data and fine-tuned it for optimal performance.

2. XGBoost
   
We also implemented an XGBoost model for comparison. Although it didn't perform as well as the RNN, you can find the code and results in the models folder.

3. ARIMA
   
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a traditional time series forecasting method. We included an ARIMA model to compare its performance with our machine learning models.

## Results
After rigorous testing and evaluation, we found that the RNN model outperformed the other methods in predicting future weather temperatures.
